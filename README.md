# Synthetic Data Generation & Validation Workflow Using R's bnlearn package

## Objective
Create reliable synthetic survey data that protects privacy while maintaining analytical value. R's bnlearn package uses Bayesian

## Action from Results
Leverage tuning reports and interactive dashboards to choose synthesis settings offering the best balance between disclosure risk and data quality. Detect and correct multi-select response inconsistencies to ensure dependable insights and stakeholder confidence.

## Background
Synthetic data lets analysts explore sensitive datasets without exposing real respondents. Multi-select survey responses are especially tricky to replicate, risking inaccurate representation in summaries and visualizations. This workflow combines automated tuning with targeted validation to safeguard both privacy and data fidelity.
First option was to use synthpop package, but initial runs were too slow due to high cardinality leading to a huge number of factors built by the CART model.
This uses an alternative package called bnlearn, whose engine uses Bayesian conditional probabilities.
