# Synthetic Data Generation & Validation Workflow

## Objective
Create reliable synthetic survey data that protects privacy while maintaining analytical value. Focus on parameter tuning with privacy-utility tradeoffs and rigorous validation of complex multi-select variables essential for accurate dashboards.

## Action from Results
Leverage tuning reports and interactive dashboards to choose synthesis settings offering the best balance between disclosure risk and data quality. Detect and correct multi-select response inconsistencies to ensure dependable insights and stakeholder confidence.

## Background
Synthetic data lets analysts explore sensitive datasets without exposing real respondents. Multi-select survey responses are especially tricky to replicate, risking inaccurate representation in summaries and visualizations. This workflow combines automated tuning with targeted validation to safeguard both privacy and data fidelity.

## Process
1. **Data Preparation**: Load raw data, generate uniqueness flags capturing key identifier combinations, and assemble predictor matrices excluding direct IDs.
2. **Automated Parameter Tuning**: Run multiple syntheses varying CART parameters, measure privacy risk (replicated uniques), and data utility (KS tests), then find optimal parameters based on a weighted score.
3. **Summary Generation**: Export tuning results summary highlighting best parameters and associated risk-utility metrics.
4. **Final Synthesis & Profiling**: Generate synthetic data with optimal parameters; create profiling reports to compare real and synthetic data comprehensively.
5. **Multi-select Validation**: Explode and compare frequencies of multi-response columns to detect discrepancies; visualize with interactive Plotly dashboards saved as HTML.
6. **Post-processing (Optional)**: Manually adjust synthetic multi-select responses to align distributions more closely with original data for dashboard accuracy.

## Expected Output
- Text file summarizing parameter tuning and optimal synthesis settings.
- High-quality synthetic dataset respecting privacy and supporting analysis.
- DataExplorer HTML reports for holistic data profile comparison.
- Folder of interactive HTML dashboards comparing multi-select variable frequencies.
- Tools and insights allowing ongoing tuning and refinement of synthetic data quality.
