I created a consolidated Excel File containing a cleaned-up version of the Main roster file maintained by our Workforce Department (Excel-based) to the individual tools to ensure that the tools have updated rosters, serving as references so that when a user inputs the Employee Number in a form, it should auto-populate the form with the other Employee Details. I made the connections via Power Query. I, then, created another separate data dump for collecting all the submissions from the individual tools, which serves as the main raw data source file I used for the Power BI Report I also created which shows some visuals about the % of each Attrition depending on Site Location, Position, Tenurity, Main Separation reason, etc. I've also integrated a compliance tracker as well in order to monitor each of the Accounts/Departments.","IT, BPO, and Business Services",Career shifter,Work city different from residence,Makati City,"15,001 to 25,000",Full-time,"Anywhere, as I'm not really being required to go onsite, but I do choose to go onsite during the latter half of my shifts because I wait for my partner to finish her shift - she works also in the same company, but her shift finishes 3hours after mine ends.",Reports Analyst - mainly maintaining and developing Power BI and Excel-based reports.,"Management, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Developer",2 to 3,None,Power Query,None,None,Power BI,None,None,None,None,None,"Excel, OneDrive, MS Teams","DAX (Power BI), M language (Power Query), VBA","Chatgpt, Copilot",PythonAnywhere Jupyter Notebook,laptop,"No, I just found out now.",,"Data Analytics Philippines, Datasense Philippines, Power Apps Pilipinas Community, Power BI Philippines UG","Career advancement, Continued learning, Upskill / Skill acquisition","Answer surveys, Connect with sponsors, Coordinate during events, Joint initiative with other groups, Volunteer for group initiatives",None so far,Social Media - I started as an Agent in the company I'm working at and eventually moved up to my current role.,Multinational employer
